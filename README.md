# `ros`
Run Odd Static

best explanation: reverse nix (binaries only, not reproducable at all, no old versions stored)

install with `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://ba.sh/vzFm)" selfinstall`.

## nope
1. versioning
2. more than binaries and scripts
3. metadata/versioning
4. dependancies (if you don't have a shell + coreutils, you are an idiot)
5. hooks or triggers
6. any other repos
7. rollbacks or old version caching (locally or on the server)
